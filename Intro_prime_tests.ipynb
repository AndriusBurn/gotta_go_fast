    "# Introduction to faster Python: Prime checking\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Author: Andrius Burnelis\n",
    "\n",
    "We are often tasked with handling many calculations using Python. The standard approach is to write up a Jupyter notebook, or write some script that can loop through the calculations you need to perform. Standard Python _can_ be fast, however when compared to variations of C, Fortran, or others Python can feel a bit sluggish. The goal of this notebook is to equip you with a few tools that can help you make your Python runtimes competitive against codes written with some flavor of C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example problem that we are tasked with is to use Python to define a function that will take an array of integers and perform a check to see which numbers are prime. The function will then return an array containing the indices of the prime numbers. This is a simple problem to solve, so we are using this as an illustrative example. In this notebook I will show you various approaches to speeding up your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have a fair timing comparison between the different methods, it is important we use the same array throughout the notebook. I define the test array here as an array of 100 randomly generated integers between 0 and 5000. You can feel free to modify the test array to whatever size you may like. The only stipulation here is that you make sure that the array only contains integers as some functions may not be coded to handle different data types. Each function just assumes that the input array is formatted properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The timing of these methods can be dependent on hardware. All timings mentioned in this notebook are from my personal laptop, so timings or improvements may be different on your computer."

    "[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org) is a Python library that utilizes just-in-time (JIT) compilation to dramatically boost the speed of some codes. Importing this package grants you the ability to use the decorator before a function you want to compile. Just-in-time compilation is a clean way to easily speed up some code. It is able to do this by exploiting the way you will likely use your code. As with many things, you will likely be computing things multiple times in loops. JIT activates the first time you encounter a piece of code. As the computer is executing the piece of code for the first time, it is also keeping track of everything that is happening and will then compile it after this first run. This first run is often slower than a standard Python call, however every subsequent call will be much faster. \n",

This tells the computer that we would like to JIT compile this function. While this decorator is versatile and simple to use, it also has its limits. Later down I show you an example designed to fail to show you how finicky this can get."

    "This is most likely due to the fact that there is a lot of array index manipulation happening here. Computational operations like this require a lot of memory overhead; the computer needs to read and write a lot of data multiple times. We need to extract the primes from the sieve, compare to the original test array, and then spit out the indices that match the primes in the test array. This is still a bit faster than the non-JIT counter-part from above, but is significantly slower than our previous method. This is an example where the optimal solution is some combination of multiple methods."

Cython allows you to write Python-like syntax which is then compiled into a C script that you can import and call from Python. I have personally used this method in my research and took code that ran for about a week to run in only a few hours. This method can speed up your code by quite a lot, but there are some downsides such as compatability. It is more readable like Python, but there are a few minor changes to the syntax that I will show you here."
